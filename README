	  ********************


1. Installation

  Simply run 
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
    sud texhash

  By default, the installation uses /usr/local as prefix. This
  behaviour can be changed by passing the --prefix=/new/prefix option
  to the configure command.

2. Execution

  Just run chklref texfile

  To run ckhlref, you need a Perl interpreter. As no special Perl
  packages are needed, a very basic Perl distribution should be ok.

3. Auto completion

   Bash users can add 

        complete -f -X '!*.tex' chklref

   to their .bashrc to activate the autocompletion using exclusively
   files with the .tex extension
