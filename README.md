# Installation

## System wide installation

### Installation into the TeX structure

This package follows the TDS[1]

- put the TeX package `chklref.sty` into `$(texmf_prefix)/tex/latex/chklref`
- put the manual `chklref.pdf` into `$(texmf_prefix)/doc/latex/chklref`
- put the Perl parser `chklref.pl` into `$(texmf_prefix)/scripts/chklref`

Note that you will also need to make a link or copy `chklref.pl` to a location in your `PATH`. On Unix systems, you may need to set the script as executable.

Depending on your OS and TeX distribution, the `TEXMF` directory `texmf_prefix` can have different values

- **Single account installation under Linux** `~/texmf`.
- **Single account installation under Mac OS X** `~/texmf` or `$HOME/Library/texmf`.
- **System wide installation under Linux** `/usr/share/texmf-local/`.
- **System wide installation under Mac OS X** `/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/`.
- **Under Windows** something like `C:\localtexmf\`. Check in your distribution settings.

**You may need to run `texhash` to update your TeX Directory Structure.**

The fastest way to carry out the installation is to use the file `chklref.tds.zip` included in the numbered releases (not available inside the git repository). You just have to unzip it inside the proper `texmf_prefix`. Alternatively, you can copy the files by hand. On Unix systems, you may need to set the script as executable.

#### Local installation

Instead of carrying out a system wide installation, you can simply copy the package file `chklref.sty` next to your main LaTeX file and put the Perl script `chklref.pl` next to it or in anywhere in your `PATH`. On Unix systems, you may need to set the script as executable.

## Requirements

The `chklref` tool is written mainly in TeX with a small Perl script to parse the output generated by the TeX package. It should be working with any standard Perl installation.

The Perl script calls a LaTeX compiler to extract labels related information.

## Execution

Just run: `perl chklref.pl file.tex`

You can get the list of available options by calling `perl chklref.pl --help`.
