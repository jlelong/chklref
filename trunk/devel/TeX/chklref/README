1. Installation

  Simply run 
	./configure
	make
	make install

  By default, the installation uses /usr/local as prefix. This behaviour can be
  changed by passing the --prefix=/new/prefix option to the configure command.

2. Execution

  Just run chklref texfile

  To run ckhlref, you need a Perl interpreter. As no special Perl packages
  are needed, a very basic Perl distribution should be ok.
